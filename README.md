The special repack of "Lua for Windows" â¸º 9000XZ noob-friendly limited edition!

With this repack, there are no pre-compiled binaries, you need to build/compile Lua from source.  
Furtunately, this repack comes with several additions regarding the building/compiling phase, featuring:  
- Written in pure Batch, no prerequisites at all (no external dependencies; other than either VS *or* Windows SDK)
- One-click Batch script to download and extract official Lua source code
- One-click Batch script to build/compile Lua (requires Visual Studio 2019 installed)
- One-click Batch script to install Lua, setting up system environment variables (requires admin privileges)
- Visual Studio 2019 solution with 3 main projects (to compile `lua.dll` / `lua.exe` / `luac.exe` individually)
- - Includes bonus project! Fully functional, simple Lua C embedding example.
